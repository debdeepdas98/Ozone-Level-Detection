# Ozone-Level-Detection
Analyzing Ozone Level Detection using KNN, SVM and Random Forest
Raw Dataset is obtained from the site and then the data is
preprocessed. Post preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and
testing data. Then the three Machine Learning models are created and
training data is fit in the model. The three models chosen are:
1. K-Nearest Neighbor
2. Support Vector Mechanism (SVM)
3. Random Forest
After the models are trained, the model values are predicted using the
testing dataset. Then the performance of the models is evaluated using
three metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The best model is
thereby chosen
